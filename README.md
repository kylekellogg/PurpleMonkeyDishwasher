PurpleMonkeyDishwasher Game Jam
===============================

The general idea is aliens infiltrating the CIA. One player is chosen to be the starting alien (the betrayer). That player queues up actions for N turns at the very beginning from a list of possible actions available to them. If one of these actions happens to "kill" a CIA agent, they turn the CIA agent into an alien. Every turn, <u>every</u> player votes on the group action for that turn with the goal being rooting out the starting alien. If, instead, they root out a CIA agent that was turned, they kill that player and they can no longer take part in the game. When the aliens' queue runs out after N turns, they renew it (by voting, if there is more than one).

The core mechanics are as follows:
1. Group actions are all poll based and every active player votes
2. The alien(s) queue up N turns of actions
3. Every CIA agent "killed" turns into an alien
