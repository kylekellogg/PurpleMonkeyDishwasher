===============================
The general idea is aliens infiltrating the CIA.

Aliens
------
Only one player is chosen as the initial alien. Imagine this player like a queen or something similar. They have the ability to create other aliens by "killing" or turning CIA agents if they find themselves alone with that CIA agent. The aliens all vote together to queue up the actions for the next N turns, allowing them less freedom to modify their plan of attack should things go unexpectedly.

CIA Agents
----------
All other players start as CIA agents. Their goal is to root out the initial alien (the queen), in order to stop the spread of the alien takeover. If they root out a former CIA agent (now an alien) instead, they can kill that alien and remove them from the game.

Every turn
----------
__All__ players, every turn, vote for the group based action. Obviously, the more aliens there are the less likely anything productive is going to happen. However, this allows the CIA agents to make quicker changes to their strategy should they need to do so.

Core mechanics
--------------
1.  Group actions are all poll based and every active player votes
2.  The alien(s) queue up N turns of actions
3.  Every CIA agent "killed" turns into an alien
