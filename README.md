PurpleMonkeyDishwasher Game Jam: Betrayal
===============================
Being in the CIA is hard. Stealing the CIA's secrets is even harder.

## Agents

Every player is a CIA agent. Agents' job is to protect the secrets
scattered throughout CIA HQ. Agents attempt to weed out moles in the
agency by watching other agents, tracking crimes that occur in the
building, and ultimately killing agents they suspect of being moles.

## Moles

One player is a mole disguised as an agent. Moles must blend in to the
agency while simultaneously stealing secrets. Moles must poison agents
that guard the secrets. However, leaving bodies behind may expose them
as the mole. So moles must be quick to leave the scene of the crime
before they're caught by other agents.

## Agents Killing Moles

Agents have a finite amount of bullets they can use to kill the
suspected mole. Accidentally killing a normal agent blacks the screen
for N seconds.
